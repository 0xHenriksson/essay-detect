              "\"Hedda Gabler Theme Essay\\n\\tLife is commonly filled with mishaps and unfair standards that may push one past their breaking point. From unfair treatment and oppression, to tragedy, life is filled with complex challenges that may affect every person in a different way, completely flipping the morals and minds of characters. Throughout Henrik Ibsen’s Play Hedda Gabler, Hedda, the main character, embodies the difficulties and struggles of life, especially for women throughout the 19th century. Hedda is trapped in a loop filled with tragedy and manipulation that leads to her eventually tragic demise, struggles with identity, and the oppressive constraints of societal gender roles, completely altering her character while also conveying a deeper message through her character. The journey of Hedda reveals key themes that serve to highlight the tragedies of Heddas life, the extreme inner turmoil regarding her identity, and her deep battle against the confining expectations placed upon women during the time. Through her actions and desires, Ibsen negatively connotated the mistreatment of women at the time, displaying Hedda as both a figure of admiration and contempt.\\nHeddas life unfolds as a tragic narrative marked by a series of desperate attempts to have control over her own life as well as others, despite the constant struggles she’s faced leading her away from this life. This is clearly illustrated in the fate of her former lover, Eljert Lovborg, whose suicide by gunshot reveals Hedda’s direct responsibility and manipulation that led to this tragedy. Hedda is exposed to be a very manipulative character due to her personal inner conflict. According to  Puja Sarkar in his undergraduate research paper,“Hedda appeared to be a female character filled with malicious intent and no clear objective.” Sarkar emphasizes Hedda dissociation with other people's emotions, manipulating and completely altering people's lives without a true intent. She simply is insecure, and  highlights harsh emotions that lead to her tragic demise. The line “Well then, somewhere else. I don't know exactly. I only know that he was found-- He had shot himself-- in the breast” (Ibsen Act 4, Pg 62), which conveys not only the tragedy of Lovborg's demise, but also really illustrates the extreme manipulation tactics that Hedda uses to gain control over others, completely glazing over that fact that she is the reason Lovborg even had the gun, primarily due to her inability to be content within her own life. As she hands hands Lovborg the gun and says, “Take it-- and do you use it now” (Ibsen Act 4, page 56), it serves as a chilling foreshadowing of his tragic end, while also displaying the disgusting actions Hedda has commited due to her own mental struggles with the constraints of society Hedda’s suicide later in the play truly helps to further the theme of harened and unecessary tragedy, believing she has no escape from a life bound by societal expectations, she chooses death over continuing to live. The moment she ends her life serves as an act of defiance, reflecting her tragic desire to be independent in an oppressive world, feeling as if there was no escape: “Shot herself! Shot herself in the temple! Fancy that!” (Act 4). Thus, her life and death embody the tragic consequences of societal constraints that have drained the hope out of her\\nHedda’s conflict with her identity is deeply linked with her societal role and personal wants, not needs. She is married to George Tessman who is an academic man interested in \\nresearch, yet she finds herself trapped in a traditional domestic houserole that doesn’t satisfy her and leads her to feel like she is lacking independence and true purpose in her life. This leads her to question her value and purpose, wondering if there is an alternative life for her out there, where she is independent and leading the life she truly strives for. Although she confronts the reality of her pregnancy, Hedda struggles to deal with her emotions regarding this new chapter, grappling with her desire for meaning in her life. Her contemplation of violence aimed at her body; aiming the muzzle of a pistol at her stomach; reveals a profound disconnect between her self perception and societal expectations, while also foreshadowing her future for the audience. Ibsen captures her despair as she continues to struggle with her emotions and foreshadows suicide, highlighting her inability to fulfill the demands of her identity and societal obligations. This internal battle ultimately leads to her tragic demise, failing to find a path that aligns with her own wants, leading the readers to understand the complex theme that unfortunately inner conflict can lead to deep tragedy while tearing a person down inside and out, brick by brick.\\nHedda’s experience vividly illustrates the conflict between the restrictive societal roles assigned to women and her desire for independence and power. Living as a housewife in a very traditional role, she perceives her role as oppressive. This leads her to yearn for a life that ascends past these expectations placed upon her, leading her to believe this is the solution to the complex desire she has to escape from everything. Throughout the playwright, Ibsen continuity implies that Hedda’s ambitions and attempts to achieve this life were continuously thwarted by the anchor that was society, and the moral obligations that were expected of her at the time. In a short essay labeled “Problems of Identity in Hedda Gabler”, written by Yvonne L. Sandstroem, it is quoted that “For Hedda too, the return to Norway means a return to a changed status. She is now Jorge Tessman’s wife rather than General Gabler's daughter…” Sandstroem does an amazing job representing how women were labeled back then. Simply as almost beneficiaries or objects to the men in their lives. Women didn’t have their own title or their own destiny, which is mainly why Hedda deeply struggled with the common societal constraints that held her back from who she believed she could be, characterizing her embodiment of deep resentment for these constraints and her life in general. She also expresses this resentment when she declares “Yes, I have. I want for once in my life to have power to mild a human destiny”( Ibsen Act 2, Pg 42). This desire to engage in a world that is traditionally dominated by men signifies her rejection of womanhood as defined by the Victorian era. Her push against these boundaries would however, result in destructive consequences as her attempts to seize power lead to her isolation and eventual downfall. Hedda’s struggles for power are not merely personal, it is symbolic of a much broader spectrum of societal tensions, truly illustrating the tragic cost of defying gender roles at the time.\\nHedda Gabler serves as a powerful exploration of tragedy, identity, and the true effects of the conflict between societal gender roles and personal aspirations. Ibsen created Hedda as a character whose flaws and desires connect and resonate deeply with the audience, challenging them to relate to her and understand the turmoil she truly faced. The tragic narrative of Hedda not only critiques the limitations placed upon women throughout the Victorian Era, but also invites a reflection on the tension that is caused by societal expectations and the pursuit of fulfillment in one's life. Through her pain, struggles, and defiance, Ibsen is able to display Hedda as an enduring symbol of the struggle for identity while being told you’re supposed to be one way your entire life. This helped to craft Hedda as both a relatable figure to the audience, as well as a tragic figure.\\nWork Cited\\n https://dspace.bracu.ac.bd/xmlui/handle/10361/17226\\nSarkar, Puja. “Identity, Self-Realization and the Embodiment of Womanhood in Henrik Ibsen’s Nora Helmer and Hedda Gabler.” Dspace.bracu.ac.bd, June 2022, dspace.bracu.ac.bd/xmlui/handle/10361/17226.
